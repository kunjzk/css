# Landing page

### HTML

1. Main div called container - everything goes in here
2. Sub div called content - this is our card
3. Content within card: image, header, paragraph, simple form for submitting email

### Styling

1. Set margin and padding of doc to 0, set font.
   1.1 Margin is the area outside the border, padding is the area between content and the border
2. Main container: set background color. Display is flex and all content is centralized. height 100%.
3. Content div ie card: set background color, centralize all text, small amount of padding, border radius to make it look like a card, max width for mobile friendly display.
4. Logo needs to have a max size, controlled by width and object-fit
5. text within card is given color and bottom margin to allow for better spacing
6. Form display is flex and flex direction content so that input and button are stacked on each other.
7. Minor styling for input field and button: padding, border radius, background color. Button has a nice bgc change and a transition property that changes the color over a given period of time.
